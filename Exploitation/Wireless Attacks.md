# Wireless Attacks 

The aim of a wireless attack is to capture information sent across the network and intrude with the network traffic. There are four main attacks, 

1. Packet Sniffing ( Discussed in another section ) 
2. Rogue Access Points 
3. Jamming 
4. Evil Twinning 

### Rogue Access Points

A Rogue AP is any access point that is unauthorized on a network. These access points make the entire network suseptible to DDoS attacks, packet captures, and ARP poisoning. 

### Jamming

Creating wireless interference within a network causes other mehthods of wireless attacks to become more accesible. Bluetooth devices, a microwave oven, or a cordless phone are small factors that can cause this interference to happen. 

### Evil Twinning

By configuring a wireless access point exactly as the target existing network, attackers can take a Mr. Hyde form. The attacker's access point is indistinguishable from the actual access points. 

## 802.11 Wireless Tools

### bully 

A Wi-Fi protected Setup (WPS) allows users to configure devices in a network without needing to type in a passphrase, rather just a small PIN. This makes brute force attacks perfect to exploit that vulnerability. Bully is the tool to use for this scenario. 

**bully mon0 -b 00:25:9C:97:4F:48 -e Mandela2 -c 9**

1. **mon0** is the name of the wireless adapter in monitor mode.

2. **--b 00:25:9C:97:4F:48** is the BSSID of the vulnerable AP.

3. **-e Mandela2** is the SSID of the AP.

4. **-c 9**  is the channel the AP is broadcasting on.

bully can also be used to gain informationfor the offline pixiewps tool. 

### aircrack-ng

Aircrack-ng is special through its method of containing tools that aid the processes of detection, packet sniffing, and password cracking.

It contains tools such as, 

1. Airmon-ng
2. Airodump-ng
3. Aireplay-ng
4. Airbase-ng

##### Airmon-ng 

A script that puts a network interface card into monitor mode, thus allowing the capturing of packets to be available without authenication or a connection to an access point. 

**airmon-ng start <\interface name\>**

The command above will concatenate the interface name with "mon" to inform that the monitor mode has been enabled. 

##### Airodump-ng

Captures and saves raw data packets after monitor mode has been enabled. 

**airodump-ng <\interface name\>** # the new interface name with the monitor mode enabled. 

The command above displayes all the access points and their MAC addresses. 

##### Aireplay-ng 

Aireplay can capture traffic from a live network or use packets from an existing Pcap file to inject into network, thus creating artificial traffic. 

##### Aircrack-ng 

Aircrack is then run to brute force the WEP/WPA key. 

## Bluetooth Tools

### spooftooph

Abilities that spooftooph contains: 

1. Clone and log Bluetooth device information

2. Generate a random new Bluetooth profile

3. Change Bluetooth profile every X seconds

4. Specify device information for Bluetooth interface

5. Select device to clone from scan log

**spooftooph -i <\interface\> -s -d scan.log**

The command above: 

1. Scans a local area for devices 
2. Saves the list of devices found 

**spooftooph -i <\interface\> -r**

The command above randomly generates a bluetooth profile. 

**spooftooph -i <\interface\> -t 10** 

The command above scans for devices every 10 seconds and clones the first profile on the list.
